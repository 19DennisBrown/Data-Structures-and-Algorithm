_____DSA BINARY SEARCH

Searches through an array and returns the index of the value it searches for.

It  is much faster than linear serch but requires a sorted array to work.

___How it works.
✅Check the value in the center of the array.
✅If the value is lower, search the left half of the array. If the value is higher, search the right half.
✅Continue step 1 and 2 for the new reduced part of the array until the target value is found or until the search area is empty.
✅If the value is found, return the target value index and if not found, return -1.

__Implementation:
✅An array with values to search through.
✅A target value to search for.
✅A loop that runs as long as left index is less or equal to the right index.
✅An if-statement that compares the middle value with the target value, and returns the index if the target value is found.
✅An if-statement that checks if the value is less than , the middle value, and update the 'left' or 'right' variables to narrow down the search area.
✅After the loop, return -1, because at this point the target value has not been found.
