___DSA LINEAR SEARCH__

It searches through an array and returns the index value it searches for.

_____How it works__
1. Go through the array value by value from the start.
2. Compare each value to check if it equal to the value being looked for.
3. If the value is found, return the index of that value.
4. If the end of the array is reached and the value is not found, return -1 to indicate that the value was not found.

____Linear search implementation__
1. An array with values to search through.
2. A target value to search for.
3. A loop that goes through the array from start to end.
4. An if-statement that compares the current value with the target value, and returns the current index if the target value id found.
5. After the loop, return -1, because at this point we know the target value has not been found.
