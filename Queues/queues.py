A queue is a data structure that hold many elements
Organises elements in LIFO way.

Basic Operations
  -Enqueue
  -Dequeue
  -Peek
  -isEmpty
  -Size

Implementation
  -Arrays {Memory efficient, Easier to implement and understand: dadvgs-Fixed size, shifting cost, better alternatives}
  -Linked list{Dynamic sizing, No shifting: dadvgs-Extra memory, Readability due complexity}
