"""
A stack is data structure that can hold many elements.
Basic operations:
  push: Adding new on the stack.
  Pop: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
  Peek: Returns the top element on the stack.
  isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
  size: Finds the number of elements in the stack.


IMPLEMENTATION.
  -Arrays : memory efficient , easier to implement and understand. disadvantage is they are fixed in size.
  -Linked list; Dynamic in size. Disadvantage is that they are Memory inefficient and harder to read and write.
